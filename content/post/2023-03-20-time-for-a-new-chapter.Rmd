Having spent the last three years as a Data Scientist at Location Labs by Avast and later at Smith Micro Software Inc (following the division's acquisition from Avast), I am now seeking my next opportunity. In my previous role, I fulfilled multiple responsibilities, including supporting the product development team and spearheading the development of a cutting-edge Data Science Platform and workflow based on open-source tooling, using a microservices/API approach.

Alas, this will give me more time to dive into some personal projects and to post more content here.

More to come!
