```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

In order to illustrate data modeling techniques, and also experiment and learn, the following data analysis will be carried out and discussed. This blog will be an iterative process--meaning it may be incomplete to the viewer at any given time. Nonetheless, it will be public in it's unfinished state for the purpose of feedback and discussion. All code for this analysis can be found at: https://github.com/kwbonds/crudeoil_products. Please Feel free to clone/fork. And please comment to me at kevin.w.bonds@gmail.com with any helpful suggestions or feedback. I greatly incourage it.

I'll attempt to show some basic data ingestion, data preparation, visualization, and predictive modeling techniques in the process. I will use the _R_ programming language with R Markdown for this document. 

The first thing to do, is to load the needed libraries. I like to keep these collected at the top of any analysis, rather that scattered throughout, for future reference. A quick thank you to all the package developers for the following packages. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)
library(zoo)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(yardstick)
library(Metrics)
library(astsa)
```

# Collecting data

I'll start with some time series analysis using crude oil products. This data can be found as an xls file that can be downloaded from: https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/PET_PRI_SPT_S1_M.htm. 

I'll load the data and do some quick formatting. After taking a quick look, I'll begin modeling the data and making some predictions. 

## Loading the data

Load the individual Excel tabs into tables and join them into one big table. Then add Month-over_Month and Year-over-Year for later. We'll do additional work to add other features in a bit.


```{r load_crude_oil, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Read rest of data directly from xlsx file into tables
# raw_data_path <- "/Users/Kevin/Documents/FitBit/fitbit_interiew_project/DATA/raw_data_sheet.xlsx"
# sheets <- raw_data_path %>%
#        excel_sheets() %>% 
#        set_names()
#crude_oil <- read_excel(raw_data_path, sheet = sheets[2], skip = 2, col_types = c("date", "numeric", "numeric")) %>% 
#        mutate("Date2" = as.Date(as.yearmon(Date, "%b-%Y"), frac = 1),
#               "Month" = month(Date2),
#               "Year" = year(Date2))
```

```{r}
crude_oil <- readRDS("../../crude_oil.rds")
```


```{r}
crude_oil <- crude_oil %>% 
        mutate("Date2" = as.Date(as.yearmon(Date, "%b-%Y"), frac = 1),
               "Month" = month(Date2),
               "Year" = year(Date2),
               "MoM_crude_oil" = 
                       (`Cushing, OK WTI Spot Price FOB (Dollars per Barrel)` - 
                                lag(`Cushing, OK WTI Spot Price FOB (Dollars per Barrel)`))/ 
                       lag(`Cushing, OK WTI Spot Price FOB (Dollars per Barrel)`),
               "YoY_crude_oil" = 
                       (`Cushing, OK WTI Spot Price FOB (Dollars per Barrel)` - 
                                lag(`Cushing, OK WTI Spot Price FOB (Dollars per Barrel)`, 12))/ 
                       lag(`Cushing, OK WTI Spot Price FOB (Dollars per Barrel)`, 12))
```

## Adding some quick stats

```{r yearly_stats, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Calculate yearly stats
year_stats <- crude_oil %>% 
        group_by(Year) %>% 
        summarize( "yr_mean_crude" = mean(`Cushing, OK WTI Spot Price FOB (Dollars per Barrel)`),
                   "yr_median_crude" = median(`Cushing, OK WTI Spot Price FOB (Dollars per Barrel)`))
# Join to larger dataframe
crude_oil <- dplyr::left_join(crude_oil, year_stats, by = c("Year" = "Year"))
kable(crude_oil[12:17,], caption= "Table with Yearly Stats")
```

```{r load_rest_of_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#conv_gasoline <- read_excel(raw_data_path, sheet = sheets[3], skip = 2, col_types = c("date", "numeric", "numeric")) %>% 
#        mutate("Month" = month(Date), "Year" = year(Date))
#RBOB_gasoline <- read_excel(raw_data_path, sheet = sheets[4], skip = 2, col_types = c("date", "numeric")) %>% 
#        mutate("Month" = month(Date), "Year" = year(Date))
#heating_oil <- read_excel(raw_data_path, sheet = sheets[5], skip = 2, col_types = c("date", "numeric")) %>% 
#        mutate("Month" = month(Date), "Year" = year(Date))
#uls_diesel <- read_excel(raw_data_path, sheet = sheets[6], skip = 2, col_types = c("date", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric")) %>% 
#        mutate("Month" = month(Date), "Year" = year(Date))
#jet <- read_excel(raw_data_path, sheet = sheets[7], skip = 2, col_types = c("date", "numeric")) %>% 
#        mutate("Month" = month(Date), "Year" = year(Date))
#propane <- read_excel(raw_data_path, sheet = sheets[8], skip = 2, col_types = c("date", "numeric")) %>% 
#        mutate("Month" = month(Date), "Year" = year(Date))
# kable(crude_oil[12:17,], caption= "Table with MoM and YoY")
```

```{r load_all}
conv_gasoline <- readRDS("../../conv_gasoline.rds")
RBOB_gasoline <- readRDS("../../RBOB_gasoline.rds")
heating_oil <- readRDS("../../heating_oil.rds")
uls_diesel <- readRDS("../../uls_diesel.rds")
jet <- readRDS("../../jet.rds")
propane <- readRDS("../../propane.rds")
```


Since prices are taken at the end of the month, dates are converted to month end just for clarity.

```{r join_all, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
# Join conv_gasoline and heating_oil
energy_df <- 
        left_join(crude_oil, conv_gasoline[,2:5], by = c("Year" = "Year", "Month" = "Month")) %>% 
        left_join(heating_oil[,2:4], by = c("Year" = "Year", "Month" = "Month")) %>%
        left_join(uls_diesel[-1], by = c("Year" = "Year", "Month" = "Month")) %>% 
        left_join(RBOB_gasoline[-1], by = c("Year" = "Year", "Month" = "Month")) %>% 
        left_join(jet[-1], by = c("Year" = "Year", "Month" = "Month")) %>% 
        left_join(propane[-1], by = c("Year" = "Year", "Month" = "Month"))
energy_df <- energy_df %>% select("Date"= `Date2`, c(5:6, 2:3, 7:length(energy_df)))
kable(head(energy_df))
```

# Modeling crude oil

Let's go ahead and try some ARIMA modeling. To create a time series model for crude oil price we should determine what sort of model may best fit. Looking at the plot of the data:

```{r tidy=TRUE}
ggplot(energy_df, aes(x = energy_df$Date, y = energy_df$`Cushing, OK WTI Spot Price FOB (Dollars per Barrel)`)) + geom_line() + ylab("WTI Spot Price (Dollars per Barrel)") + xlab("Date") + ggtitle("Monthly average for West Texas Crude Oil")
```

It appears the data is not stabilized. There is a general trend and possibly some exponential behavior. Let's try standardizing the data by log-differencing to remove trend and growth.

```{r}
cop <-  ts(energy_df$`Cushing, OK WTI Spot Price FOB (Dollars per Barrel)`, start= c(1986,1), end = c(2019,8), frequency = 12)
```

```{r}
crude_oil_returns <- log(cop)
plot(crude_oil_returns, type = "l")
```

```{r}
plot(diff(crude_oil_returns), type = "l")
```

This is looking pretty stabilized. So this suggests that an integrated model is appropriate (d = 1). So let's check the ACF and PACF of the logged data to see if we can determine if an Auto-regressive model, Moving Average model or a combined model is best.

```{r fig.height = 7, results='hide',fig.keep='all'}
acf2(crude_oil_returns)
```

The above suggests a ARIMA(1,1,0) model because the acf is tailing off and the PACF cuts at lag 1 (suggesting AR = 1). I'll use the _sarima_ package to create the model and to do some forecasting. _sarima_ has some nice tools for this.

```{r model_1, fig.width= 9, results='hide',fig.keep='all'}
ar_sim_x <- sarima(crude_oil_returns, p = 1, d = 1, q = 0)
```

```{r}
ar_sim_x
```
We can see from above, the AR1 parameter is significant as the p.value is zero. Also, we note to AIC and BIC for comparison with subsequent models. We want these to be as small as possible.

Let's try adding a parameter and see if that improves things? We are looking for the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to judge the strength of the model. The lower these values the more information is captured. 

```{r model_2, fig.width= 9, results='hide',fig.keep='all'}
ar_sim_x_2 <- sarima(crude_oil_returns, p = 2, d = 1, q = 0)
```

```{r}
ar_sim_x_2
```

That does not. We can see that the added parameter is not statistically significant and the BIC and AIC both go up. After a few more less probable attempts we can be certain that the first model is looking best.

Now let's see if adding seasonality to the model will improve it. Looking at the ACF/PCF for the differenced data. 

```{r seasonal_acf, results='hide',fig.keep='all'}
acf2(diff(diff(crude_oil_returns), 48))
```

From the ACF/PACF it seems that the ACF may trail off at each log (12 months) and the PCF cuts off. But the signal is small if any. We can try to add a seasonal AR and see what happens. 


```{r model_3, fig.width= 9, results='hide',fig.keep='all'}
ar_sim_x_3 <- sarima(crude_oil_returns, p = 1, d = 1, q = 0, P = 1, D = 0, Q = 0, S = 12)
```

```{r}
ar_sim_x_3
```


This model is not better. The seasonal AR is not significant and the AIC and BIC have increased. Seems adding a seasonal component doesn't improve the model. 

Now that we are satisfied with the non-seasonal ARIMA(1,1,0), let's forecast 6 months ahead. We'll use the sarima package

```{r}
oil_for <- sarima.for(cop, n.ahead = 6, 1,1,0)
oil_for$pred
```
# Gas Prices

```{r}
gas_price <- ts(energy_df$`New York Harbor Conventional Gasoline Regular Spot Price FOB (Dollars per Gallon)`, start= c(1986,1), end = c(2019,8), frequency = 12)
```

```{r}
plot(diff(gas_price), type = "l")
```

```{r}
gas_returns <- log(gas_price)
plot(gas_returns, type = "l")
```

```{r}
plot(diff(gas_returns), type = "l")
```

```{r acf2_gas_prices, results='hide',fig.keep='all'}
acf2(gas_returns)
```


```{r gas_mdl_1, results='hide',fig.keep='all'}
gas_mdl <- sarima(gas_returns, p = 2, d = 1, q = 0)
gas_mdl
```

```{r gas_mdl_2, results='hide',fig.keep='all'}
gas_mdl <- sarima(gas_returns, p = 1, d = 1, q = 2)
gas_mdl
```
 
```{r}
sarima.for(gas_price, 1,1,2, n.ahead = 6)
```
